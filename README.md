# Password Generator

This mini project focuses on creating an application that can generate a random password utilizing dynamically updated HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The functionality of the password generator works after the "Generate Password" button is pressed and proceeds to prompt the user to choose the criteria for the password.
The user is then prompted to choose the number of characters they want their generated password to be. 
It must be between 8 and 128 characters or else the given password would not work. 
If the listed requirement is not met, the "Generate Password" button must be clicked again to retry. 
The user can choose any combination of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters by clicking through the prompts on the website. 
After completing the prompts, the password will be generated based on your chosen criteria.
